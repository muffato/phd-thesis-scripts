During my PhD I initiated and wrote the Agora ancestral-genome
reconstruction toolkit. Although I was not using any version control
system, I was still making regular backups of my workspace. This repository
links those snapshots and give a little bit of history about this project.

The final product is available in another repository:
https://github.com/DyogenIBENS/Agora/ , and the reconstructions are
released on the Genomicus browser http://www.genomicus.biologie.ens.fr/genomicus/
